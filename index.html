                <p>Good day! I am a practicing web developer based out of Atlanta, GA.
                 I am interested in this field because it challenges me in new and 
                 exciting ways everyday. If it's one thing that i've enjoyed since i was little, it's puzzles.
                 I feel like every time i take on a new project, it's like I'm being given
                 a really fun and complex puzzle to figure out. It's not always easy, but the satisfaction i feel when
                 i successfully complete the project is amazing. I can't wait to reach my full potential and join 
                 an awesome team so i can work along side some other great programmers. When I'm not busy playing with
                 code, i enjoy playing video games, reading books, cooking, and all things beauty related. Feel free 
                 to take a peek around my page and contact me if you have any questions! </p>

                <h3>Quiz App</h3>
                <img src="Screenshot.png" alt="quiz app screenshot" class="image" width= "100%">
                <p>This is one of the first apps i've ever created. It is a very simple quiz 
                    about makeup and its about 5 questions long. Once you click the start button on the first page,
                    you will be able to glide seamlessly through each of the 5 questions. After answering each one,
                    the app will alert you as to whether you got the answer right or wrong. Your score is displayed throughout
                    the quiz as well as at the end, with the option to retake it if you wanted another shot! This app was created
                    for anyone who has an interest in the makeup and beauty industry. I built it because make-up is my favorite thing
                    to do outside of coding, so i figured it would be a great topic to base an app off of.
                    I built this quiz to test my skills with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Feel free to give it a shot!
